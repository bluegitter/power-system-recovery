# Power System Recovery

This project aims to implement an optimization model for power system recovery. The goal is to restore key loads in the distribution network as quickly as possible and to provide sufficient energy to the restored critical loads to minimize blackout losses.

## Features
- Estimation of probability density functions using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
- Optimizes the recovery process of the power distribution system.
- Uses mixed-integer linear programming to model the recovery process.
- Simulates test data to demonstrate the optimization decision-making process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PuLP library
